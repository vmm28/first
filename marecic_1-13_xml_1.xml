<ingredients>
    <ing grams="160">1 1/4 cups (160 grams) white bread flour, plus more for dusting</ing>
    <ing grams="38">1/4 cup (38 grams) stone-ground whole-wheat flour</ing>
    <ing grams="32">1/4 cup (32 grams) stone-ground whole rye flour</ing>
1/2 teaspoon instant yeast or bread machine yeast
1 teaspoon table salt
    <ing grams="55">1/4 cup (55 grams) dry fermented cider (may substitute Pilsener beer; see headnote)</ing>
    <ing grams="120">1/2 cup (120 grams) lukewarm water (80 degrees), plus an optional 1 tablespoon</ing>
</ingredients>
    
<directions>
    <step n="1">Whisk together the flours, yeast and salt in a mixing bowl. Combine the cider and water in a liquid measuring cup.</step>

    <step n="2">Add the liquid to the flour mixture; use a spatula or bench scraper or your hand moistened with water to blend them for about a minute. The dough should be shaggy yet cohesive. Cover the bowl with a towel; let the dough rest for <time minutes="20">20 minutes</time>.</step>

    <step n="3">Moisten your kneading hand. If the dough seems stiff, add the optional tablespoon of water. Stretch one edge of the dough (still in the bowl), then press it into the center of the bowl. Repeat this about a dozen times, moving clockwise to catch all sides of the dough. (This should take <time minutes="1.5">1 or 2 minutes</time>.)</step>

    <step n="4">Turn the dough over so the seams are on the bottom. Cover and let rest for <time minutes="20">20 minutes</time>. Repeat the clockwise stretching and folding two more times, with <time minutes="40">20-minute</time> rests after each. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. The dough should have doubled. If it hasn't, leave it on the counter until it does.</step>

    <step n="5">Lightly flour a work surface. Use a pastry cloth or clean dish towel to line a round colander. Dust the cloth with flour.</step>

    <step n="6">Transfer the dough to the floured work surface. Fold the edges toward the center to create a round shape, turning it over so the seams are on the bottom. Let it rest for <time minutes="5">5 minutes</time>, then transfer to the colander, seam side up. Cover with a towel and let the dough rise for <time minutes="90">1 1/2 hours</time>.</step>
    
<!-- vmm: not sure if I should count the 'thiry minutes' below as a time element since its not technically adding 30 minutes to the recipe like the other time elements. -->
    <step n="7">Thirty minutes before baking, place a cast-iron Dutch oven (lid on) or enameled cast-iron pot with a lid (on) in the oven; preheat to <temp degrees="475" scale="F">475 degrees</temp>.</step>

    <step n="8">Carefully remove the hot pot from the oven.</step>

    <step n="9">Turn the dough out onto the counter so the seams are on the bottom. Use kitchen scissors to make 8 snips on the top of the dough in an evenly spaced spoke pattern, each about 1/4-inch deep. Lift the dough and carefully drop it into the hot pot. Immediately cover with the hot lid. Bake for <time minutes="30">30 minutes</time>, then reduce the heat to <temp degrees="450" scale="F">450 degrees</temp>. Uncover and bake for <time minutes="9">8 to 10 minutes</time> or until the crust is dark brown. Try to minimize the amount of time the oven door is open.</step>

    <step n="10">The bread is done when its internal temperature registers <temp degrees="205" scale="F">205 degrees</temp> on an instant-read thermometer and the loaf sounds hollow when knocked on the underside.</step>

    <step n="11">Transfer the loaf to a wire rack to cool for at least <time minutes="60">1 hour</time> before cutting.</step>
